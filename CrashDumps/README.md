## Do you want to collect a crash-dump but you do not have WinDbg installed?

### No problem. With this set of scripts, you will (almost) never require WinDbg again.

Follow these steps:

1. Execute **KeepCrashDump.reg**
2. Reproduce crash.
3. Execute **IgnoreCrashDump.reg**
4. Crash dump is located in **C:\Temp\CrashDumps**
